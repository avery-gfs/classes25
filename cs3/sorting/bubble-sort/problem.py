# Implement an optimized bubble sort.
#
# - Loop backwards from the end of the list. This outer loop
#   shrinks the unsorted part of the list with each pass
#
# - In an inner loop, iterate from the start up to the unsorted boundary
#   - Compare each element to the next one
#   - If they are in the wrong order, swap them
#
# - Return the sorted list, which has been modified in-place
