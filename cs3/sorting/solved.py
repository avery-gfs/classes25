# Implement selection sort
# Don't use the built-in `min` function
#
# - Initialize an `index` variable to `0`
# - Find the smallest number in the list from `index` onward
# - Swap the smallest number with the number at `index`
# - Increment `index` by `1`
# - Repeat until `index` equals the length of the list
