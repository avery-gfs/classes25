# Write a recursive function to flatten a nested list; that is, turn
# a nested list of lists into a single flat list
#
# Hint: look into `isinstance` and `list.extend`

def flatten(nested):
    pass # Your code goes here

print(flatten([1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7])) # Should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
