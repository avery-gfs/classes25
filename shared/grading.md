# Grading Policy

Overall I'm happy with how my classes last year went. I found that the classes
that went best were the ones with the most structure. This year I'm laying out a
more formal set of expectations for my classes, as I myself work to learn and
improve as a teacher.

## Participation

- Quiet during classwork

  Please limit conversations to library-level volume when working and
  collaborating on classwork.

- Silence during lecture and presentations

  It's difficult to present to an audience when you can hear other people
  talking, so please refrain from conversations while I'm lecturing. Definitely
  do not talk when your classmates are presenting to the class.

- Ask questions, ask for help

  If you find yourself confused or stuck, please let me know, whether that's
  raising your hand during lecture, asking me or one of your classmates for help
  with an assignment, or checking in after class.

- Collaborate

  If you finish an assignment early, great! Now the real test begins: can you
  help your classmates understand the assignment, working in a way which
  strengthens both their knowledge and your own.

- Respectful and appropriate conversations

  Be kind to your classmates. Keep conversations respectful and appropriate. If
  I ask you to end a topic of conversation, please do so.

- Use computers for classwork

  Please only use computers for classwork. Put computers away during lectures
  and presentations. Do not use social media or youtube during class.

## Classwork

### Effective work

I won't assign homework for this class; you will have sufficient time in class
to complete assignments. I ask therefore that you make effective use of your
time in class. You are welcome to collaborate with others so long as you and
your partners stay on-task. Please do not use class time to work on assignments
for other classes unless you have already finished all of your classwork. Ensure
that you have disabled any built-in AI features in your coding environment.

### Completion of assignments

You should try to create working solutions to all of the assigned problems for
this class. Additionally, make sure that you understand and can explain all of
the code that you write for this class, particularly if you work in
collaboration with others. A problem is not solved if you can't explain your
solution.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be given at the end of units, and will cover the broad concepts
from the unit. I don't plan on making them especially hard.
