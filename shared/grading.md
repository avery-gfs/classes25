# Grading Policy

My goals for this class are:

- That it is easy to pass
- That it is low-stress
- That students work hard and focus in class
- That students learn a lot

Some students and teachers would see the first two goals as incompatible with
the second two, but I think that it's possible to achieve all of these goals
together. My policies for this class are designed to help you all achieve these
goals.

Class grade breakdown:

- 50% Participation
- 30% Effective work
- 20% Completion of assignments

## Participation

- Quiet during classwork

  Please limit conversations to library-level volume when working and
  collaborating on classwork.

- Leaving the classroom

  You are welcome to go to the bathroom or to get water during class, but make
  to let me know before you leave the room. If you need to leave, please try to
  do so during the classwork portion of class, rather than during lecture.

- Attention during lecture and presentations

  It's difficult to present to an audience when you can hear other people
  talking, so please refrain from conversations while I'm lecturing. Definitely
  do not talk when your classmates are presenting to the class. Put computers
  away during lectures and presentations.

- Ask questions, ask for help

  If you find yourself confused or stuck, please let me know, whether that's
  raising your hand during lecture, asking me or one of your classmates for help
  with an assignment, or checking in after class.

- Collaborate

  If you finish an assignment early, great! Now the real test begins: can you
  help your classmates understand the assignment, working in a way which
  strengthens both their knowledge and your own.

- Respectful and appropriate conversations

  Be kind to your classmates. Keep conversations respectful and appropriate. If
  I ask you to end a topic of conversation, please do so.

## Effective work

I won't assign homework for this class; you will have sufficient time in class
to complete assignments. I ask therefore that you make effective use of your
time in class. You are welcome to collaborate with others so long as you and
your partners stay on-task. Please do not use class time to work on assignments
for other classes unless you have already finished all of your classwork. Do not
use social media, go on youtube, or play games during class. Ensure that you
have disabled any built-in AI features in your coding environment.

## Completion of assignments

You should try to create working solutions to all of the assigned problems for
this class. Additionally, make sure that you understand and can explain all of
the code that you write for this class, particularly if you work in
collaboration with others. A problem is not solved if you can't explain your
solution.
