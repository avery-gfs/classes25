As a second-year programming course, this class will explore the real-world applications of software
development. How does Google know what pages to recommend in a search result? How do Instagram filters
change the way photos look? How does a calendar application calculate when repeating events will next
occur? Students will find answers to these questions and more in this project-based class.
