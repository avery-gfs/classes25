## Sprites, Images, Colors, Colliders

- Colors
- Alpha
- Editing tools
  - Brush
  - Rotate
  - Flip
  - Fill
  - Crop
  - Mirror
  - Picker
- Why rotate sprite image vs in code?

## Board Games / Card Games

- Cribbage
- Set
- ERS

---

## Chase

- Mouse position
- Continuous vs discrete events
- AI sprite follow player
- Deadzone

---

## Team Building

Hobbies, sports, siblings, future study.

## Platform

- Lateral
- Jumping
- Gravity
- Ground collision
- Platform collision
- Camera tracking

---

## Drive

- Rotation
- `console.log`
- `setSpeedAndDirection`
- `sprite.getSpeed()`
- Exponential friction
- Extra board padding

---

## Bounce

- Multi-user input
- Bouncing Collisions
- Why is ball slower when it moves horizontally?

1. Two sprites with separate controls
2. Ball with movement, bouncing off walls
3. Ball bouncing off sprites

---

## Gravity

- Stop movement when button isn't pressed
- Gravity
- Config variables
- Functions

---

## Boundary

- Boundaries
  - Stop
  - Loop
  - Bounce

## Review

- What is the purpose of the `draw` function in GameLab?
- How do we decide what code to put before the `draw` function and what to put
  inside it?

## Collisions

- 1D character controls
- Randomized spawning
- Text display
- Declaring variables
- Scoring with counter pattern

---

## Review

- What are the dimensions of the game screen in GameLab?
- Where on the game screen is the coordinate `(0, 0)`?
- What code could we use to adjust the size of a sprite?

## Movement

- Sprite velocity
- `background` and why we need it
- `function draw`
- Multiple sprites
- Sprite position
- Conditionals
