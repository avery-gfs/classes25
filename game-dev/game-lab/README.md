# Code.org game lab notes and concepts

## Definitions

### Programs and code

A **program** is a list of instructions that a computer follows to accomplish some task. We call these instructions **code**. With Code.org, you'll focus on writing code that tells the computer how to display interactive animations and run games that you design.

### Comments

**Comments** are notes in your code. Comments start with two forward slash symbols `//` and continue until the end of the line of code. The computer doesn't pay attention to comments when it runs your code.

```js
// this is a comment
```

Comments can be used to add explanations to your code, or to "turn off" sections of code temporarily.

### Sprites

A **sprite** is an image that is displayed when you run your program. A sprite can be a background, a character in a game, or any other image that you choose.

### Functions and arguments

A **function** is an instruction that tells the computer to perform some task. For example, the `keyDown("key_name")` function tells the computer to check whether a certain key is pressed on the keyboard. When you use a function in your code, we say that you "call" the function.

A **argument** is an extra piece of data that you give to a function to tell it how to perform a certain task. For example, when you use the `keyDown("key_name")` function to check if a certain key is pressed, you need to tell the function which key it should check by giving it the name of that key as the `"key_name"` argument.

```js
// check if the space key is pressed
keyDown("space");

// check if the left arrow key is pressed
keyDown("left");
```

Changing the `"key_name"` argument that we give to the `keyDown("key_name")` function changes which key it checks.

### Variables

**Variables** are names that you give to values in your program. You use the `var` keyword to make a new variable and assign it a value; then, you can use the variable name to refer to the value of the variable.

For example, we can assign numbers to variable names and then do math with those variables just like we would with the numbers.

```js
var x = 1;
var y = 2;

// equals 3
x + y;
```

### Conditionals

**Conditional** statements are used to restrict a piece of code so that it only runs when some condition is true.

```js
// check if the space key is pressed
if (keyDown("space")) {
  // increase the size of the mario sprite if the space key is pressed
  mario.scale += 1;
}
```

In the example above, `keyDown("space")` is the condition that is being checked, and `mario.scale += 1` is the code that runs when that condition is true.

A conditional always has an `if` component (code that runs when the condition is true). You can add more conditions to a conditional using `else if` components. You can use an `else` component to add code at the end of a conditional that runs if none of the conditions were true.

```js
if (keyDown("a")) {
  // do something if the "a" key is pressed
} else if (keyDown("b")) {
  // do something if the "b" key is pressed (but the "a" key isn't)
} else {
  // do something if neither the "a" key nor the "b" key are pressed
}
```

### Properties

A **property** is piece of data that is part of a larger piece of data. For example, if you have a sprite `mario` in your program, then the `x` and `y` position, `scale`, and `rotation` of the `mario` sprite are all **properties** of the sprite. You can access properties using the dot character, for example; `mario.x`, `mario.y`, `mario.scale`, and `mario.rotatation`.

Update a property:

```js
// set the size of mario to 20% of the default size
mario.scale = 0.2;
```

Read a property:

```js
// check if the x position of mario is greater than 200
if (mario.x > 200) {
  // do something when mario.x > 200
}
```

### Methods

A **method** is a function that is attached to a piece of data, like a sprite. For example, if you have a sprite `mario` in your program, then the functions `mario.setAnimation("image_name")` and `mario.isTouching(other)` are methods of the `mario` sprite. You can access methods using the dot character.

```js
// set the mario sprite to the image called "happy_mario"
mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");
```

### `x` and `y` position

On the Code.org platform, the position of sprites and shapes is described in terms of `x` (the horizontal distance from the left edge of the board) and `y` (the vertical distance from the top of the board). The `x` and `y` positions each go from `0` to `400`. The middle of the board is `(x, y) = (200, 200)`.

### Counter pattern

You can use the counter pattern to increase or decrease the value of some variable or sprite property. Unlike variable assignments which use the `=` operator, counter pattern assignments use either the `+=` or `-=` operators.

```js
// increase the score variable
score += 1;

// decrease the rotation of mario
mario.rotation -= 0.1;
```

### Draw function

The **draw function** controls the dynamic behavior of your program: moving sprites, showing and hiding sprites, and responding to keyboard and mouse input. In general, you should put _setup code_ (code that create sprites and sets their initial size and appearance) outside of the draw function and put _everything else_ inside the draw function.

## How To

### Set up a program from scratch

This is the basic code you should use when starting a project from scratch. Code to set up your program variables (like creating sprites with `createSprite(x, y)`) goes at the start of the program. Everything else should go in your draw function.

```js
// set up your program and create your sprites here

function draw() {
  // clear the background
  background("white");

  // put any code for sprite movement, collision detection,
  // and responding to user input here

  // make the sprites appear
  drawSprites();
}
```

### Create a sprite with `createSprite(x, y)`

Use the `createSprite(x, y)` function to make a new sprite. `createSprite(x, y)` takes has two arguments: the `x` and `y` values for the starting position of the sprite.

```js
// create a sprite named "mario" in the middle of the screen
var mario = createSprite(200, 200);
```

### Set the image for a sprite with `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")`

Use the `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")` method to set the image for a sprite. `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")` takes one argument: the name of the image to use for the sprite. You will need to make sure that you've imported these images and given them names in the animation tab on Code.org in order to use them in your program.

```js
var mario = createSprite(200, 200);

// set the mario sprite to the image called "angry_mario"
mario.setAnimation("angry_mario");

// note the difference between the name of the sprite (mario) and
// the name of the sprite image (angry_mario)

// to access the sprite later in the program use the
// variable name mario, not angry_mario
```

### Create multiple sprites

You can create multiple sprites by using the `createSprite(x, y)` function multiple times. Make sure that you give each sprite a unique variable name.

```js
// create a sprite named mario at position (x, y) = (100, 200)
var mario = createSprite(100, 200);
// set the image for mario to the image called "angry_mario"
mario.setAnimation("angry_mario");

// create a sprite named luigi at position (x, y) = (300, 200)
var luigi = createSprite(300, 200);
// set the image for luigi to the image called "happy_luigi"
luigi.setAnimation("happy_luigi");
```

### Change the position of a sprite with `sprite.x` and `sprite.y`

You can change the position of a sprite by changing the `x` and `y` properties of the sprite.

```js
// move the mario sprite to the bottom left corner of the board
mario.x = 0;
mario.y = 400;
```

### Sprite movement with `sprite.velocityX` and `sprite.velocityY`

You can make sprites move across the board using the `velocityX` and `velocityY` properties of a sprite.

```js
// move the mario sprite to the left with a positive x velocity
mario.velocityX = -1;

// move the mario sprite to the right with a negative x velocity
mario.velocityX = 1;

// move the mario sprite up with a positive y velocity
mario.velocityY = -1;

// move the mario sprite down with a negative y velocity
mario.velocityY = 1;
```

You can change the speed of the sprite movement by increasing or decreasing the velocity.

```js
// move the mario sprite to the left slowly
mario.velocityX = -1;

// move the mario sprite to the left quickly
mario.velocityX = -5;
```

### Set the size of a sprite with `sprite.scale`

You can change the size of a sprite by changing the `scale` property of the sprite.

```js
// set the sprite size to twice the default size
mario.scale = 2;

// set the sprite size to half the default size
mario.scale = 0.5;
```

### Change the size of a sprite with the counter pattern on `sprite.scale`

You can change the size of a sprite gradually using the counter pattern on the `sprite.scale` property.

```js
// gradually increase the size of the mario sprite
mario.scale += 0.1;

// gradually decrease the size of the mario sprite
mario.scale -= 0.1;
```

If the sprite's scale gets negative, you'll see that the sprite flips upside down and starts getting bigger again as the scale becomes a negative number. To avoid this, you can use `*=` and `/=` to scale the sprite multiplicatively and avoid getting a negative scale.

```js
// gradually increase the size of the mario sprite
mario.scale *= 1.05;

// gradually decrease the size of the mario sprite
mario.scale /= 1.05;
```

### Set the rotation of a sprite with `sprite.rotation`

You can change the rotation of a sprite by changing the `rotation` property of the sprite.

```js
// set the sprite rotation to 90 degrees clockwise
mario.rotation = 90;

// set the sprite rotation to 90 degrees counter-clockwise
mario.rotation = -90;
```

### Change the rotation of a sprite with the counter pattern on `sprite.rotation`

You can change the rotation of a sprite gradually using the counter pattern on the `sprite.rotation` property.

```js
// gradually rotate the mario sprite clockwise
mario.rotation += 1;

// gradually rotate the mario sprite counter-clockwise
mario.rotation -= 1;
```

### Show and hide a sprite using `sprite.visibility`

You can make a sprite invisible by setting the `sprite.visible` property to `false`. You can make the sprite visible again by setting the `sprite.visible` property to `true`.

```js
// hide the mario sprite
mario.visible = false;

// make the mario sprite visible again
mario.visible = true;
```

### Stopping and looping a sprite around the edges of the board

If you make the sprite move in one direction, eventually it will move off the edge of the board and disappear.

```js
// move mario to the left
// mario will eventually disappear off the left side of the board
mario.velocityX = -5;
```

If you don't want this to happen, there are a couple of things you can do.

**Option 1: stop the sprite**

You can stop the sprite from moving off the board by checking its position and only running the counter pattern when the sprite hasn't reached the edge of the board.

```js
// move mario to the left
mario.velocityX = -5;

// make mario stop when he gets to the left edge of the board

if (mario.x < 0) {
  mario.velocityX = 0;
}
```

**Option 2: loop the sprite**

You can check if the sprite has reached the edge of the board and make the sprite loop around to the opposite edge of the board.

```js
// move mario to the left
mario.velocityX = -5;

// if mario has reached the left edge of the board, move mario to the right edge of the board
// mario will keep moving left and looping around the board
if (mario.x < 0) {
  mario.x = 400;
}
```

### Display text with `text("message", x, y)`

You can use the `text("message", x, y)` function to display a text on the board. The text can be a message in double quotes, or it can be a variable or a property.

```js
// display the word hello at (x, y) = (100, 200);
text("hello", 100, 200);

// display the value of mario.x at (x, y) = (300, 400);
text(mario.x, 300, 400);
```

### Check for key presses with `keyDown("key_name")`

You can use the `keyDown("key_name")` function to check if some key is pressed down. The `"key_name"` argument controls which key the function checks.

```js
// check if the space key is pressed
if (keyDown("space")) {
  text("space is pressed", 100, 200);
} else {
  text("space is not pressed", 100, 200);
}
```

To check if a letter key is pressed, use the name of the letter as the `"key_name"` argument. For example, use `keyDown("a")` to check if the <kbd>A</kbd> key is pressed. Use `"space"` for the <kbd>space</kbd> bar, and `"left"`, `"right"`, `"up"`, `"down"` for the arrow keys.

### Using `keyDown("key_name")` with the velocity

You can use the `keyDown("key_name")` function to with the counter pattern and conditionals to control the movement of sprites using the keyboard.

```js
if (keyDown("left")) {
  // move mario left if the left arrow key is pressed
  mario.velocityX = -5;
} else if (keyDown("right")) {
  // move mario right if the right arrow key is pressed
  mario.velocityX = 5;
} else {
  // otherwise don't move mario horizontally
  mario.velocityX = 0;
}

if (keyDown("up")) {
  // move mario up if the up arrow key is pressed
  mario.velocityY = -5;
} else if (keyDown("down")) {
  // move mario down if the down arrow key is pressed
  mario.velocityY = 5;
} else {
  // otherwise don't move mario vertically
  mario.velocityY = 0;
}
```

### Check for mouse clicks with `mouseDown("leftButton")`

You can use the `mouseDown("leftButton")` function to check if the mouse is clicked. For simplicity, you should always use "leftButton" as the argument to the function.

```js
// check if the mouse is clicked
if (mouseDown("leftButton")) {
  text("mouse is clicked", 100, 200);
} else {
  text("mouse is not clicked", 100, 200);
}
```

### Changing the appearance of a sprite using `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")`

You use `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")` to set the image for a sprite in the setup code before your draw function. You can also use `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")` in your draw function to change the image for a sprite after you create it.

```js
// check if the mouse is clicked
if (mouseDown("leftButton")) {
  // change mario image to "happy_mario" when the mouse is clicked
  mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");
} else {
  // change mario image to "angry_mario" when the mouse is not clicked
  mario.setAnimation("angry_mario");
}
```

### Count events with the counter pattern

In addition to changing sprite properties, the counter pattern can also be used to count things (hence the name). To count things, you start by making a variable using `var` declaration to serve as the counter. Then, you can use the counter pattern to update the variable in response to some event.

```js
// this goes before the draw function
// we are using a variable named clicks to keep track
// of the number of mouse clicks
var clicks = 0;

// this goes inside the draw function
if (mouseClick("leftButton")) {
  // update the click count each time there is a new mouse click
  clicks += 1;
  // display the number of mouse clicks on the screen
  text(clicks, 100, 200);
}
```

## Common Issues

### Using the wrong variable name

```js
var mario = createSprite(100, 200);

// INCORRECT
// the variable name has to match exactly

nario.setAnimation("happy_mario");

// CORRECT

mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");
```

_**Note**: sometimes, if a variable name is wrong, Code.org will suggest that you need to wrap it in quotes. This suggestion is wrong. **You don't need to add quotes!** You just need to make sure that the variable name you are using matches an actual variable in your program._

### Using the animation name instead of the sprite name

```js
var mario = createSprite(100, 200);
mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");

// INCORRECT
// happy_mario is the name of the animation (the sprite image), not the sprite variable

happy_mario.velocityX = 1;

// CORRECT

mario.velocityX = 1;
```

_**Note**: sometimes, if a variable name is wrong, Code.org will suggest that you need to wrap it in quotes. This suggestion is wrong. **You don't need to add quotes!** You just need to make sure that the variable name you are using matches an actual variable in your program._

### Reusing the same variable names

```js
// INCORRECT
// using the name player for two different sprites

var mario = createSprite(100, 200);
mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");

var mario = createSprite(300, 200);
mario.setAnimation("happy_luigi");

// CORRECT
// use a different name for each sprite

var mario = createSprite(100, 200);
mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");

var luigi = createSprite(300, 200);
luigi.setAnimation("happy_luigi");
```

### Multiple draw functions

You should only have one draw function in your program.

```js
// INCORRECT
// multiple draw functions

function draw() {
  if (keyDown("left")) {
    mario.x = mario.x - 5;
  }
}

function draw() {
  if (keyDown("right")) {
    mario.x = mario.x + 5;
  }
}

// CORRECT
// one draw function

function draw() {
  if (keyDown("left")) {
    mario.x = mario.x - 5;
  }

  if (keyDown("right")) {
    mario.x = mario.x + 5;
  }
}
```

### Creating sprites in the draw function

You should always create sprites outside of the draw function.

```js
// INCORRECT

function draw() {
  var mario = createSprite(200, 200);
}

// CORRECT

var mario = createSprite(200, 200);

function draw() {
  // ...
}
```

### Forgetting to use `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")`

If you don't use `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")` to set the image for a sprite, then the sprite will show up as a gray square.

```js
var mario = createSprite(200, 200);

// if you remove this line then the mario sprite will
// show up as a gray square
mario.setAnimation("happy_mario");
```

### Missing quotes on arguments

When you use functions like `keyDown("key_name")`, `mouseClicked("leftButton")`, `sprite.setAnimation("image_name")` and `background("color_name")`, you usually want to pass a argument surrounded by double quotes.

```js
// INCORRECT
// missing quotes

keyDown(space);
background(white);
mouseClick(leftButton);
sprite.setAnimation(happy_mario);

// CORRECT

keyDown("space");
background("white");
mouseClick("leftButton");
sprite.setAnimation("happy_mario");
```

### Syntax errors

If your code is written incorrectly, the computer won't be able to understand it. When this happens we call it a **syntax error**. Syntax errors are often caused by forgetting a symbol in your code, or adding an extra symbol in your code.

```js
// INCORRECT
// missing the number after '+='

sprite.x += ;

// CORRECT

sprite.x += 1;

// INCORRECT
// missing the ')' after the function arguments

var mario = createSprite(200, 200;

// CORRECT

var mario = createSprite(200, 200);

// INCORRECT
// extra ',' between the function arguments

var mario = createSprite(200,, 200);

// CORRECT

var mario = createSprite(200, 200);
```

### Forgetting a property name

Make sure that you include the property name when you are trying to update some property of a sprite (like the `x`, `y`, `velocityX`, `velocityY`, `rotation`, `scale`, etc). If you leave the property name out it will erase your sprite and result in confusing errors.

```js
// INCORRECT
// missing the property name

mario = 1;

// CORRECT

mario.velocityX = 1;
```

### Using `var` in the wrong place

Sometimes when we set the value of a variable using `=` we use the `var` keyword, and sometimes we don't. How do we know when to use `var`?

- **Don't** use `var` when updating a property on a sprite (like `sprite.scale`)
- **Don't** use `var` when updating an existing variable (like `count = count + 1`).
- **Do** use var when making new variable, like with `createSprite(x, y)`.

```js
// INCORRECT
// using `var` when updating a property on a sprite (like `sprite.scale`)

var mario.scale = 0.5;

// CORRECT

mario.scale = 0.5;

// INCORRECT
// using `var` to update an existing variable

var count += 1;

// CORRECT

count += 1;

// INCORRECT
// not using var when making new variable, like with `createSprite(x, y)`

mario = createSprite(200, 200);

// CORRECT

var mario = createSprite(200, 200);
```

### Forgetting the `drawSprites()` function

If you don't include the `drawSprites()` function in your draw function, then the sprites you create will now show up. You normally want to put `drawSprites()` at the very end of your draw function.

```js
// INCORRECT
// no drawSprites(), so sprites won't show up

function draw() {
  background("white");

  // ...
}

// CORRECT

function draw() {
  background("white");

  // ...

  drawSprites();
}
```

### Forgetting the `background("color_name")` function

Normally, you need to call the `background("color_name")` function in your draw function in order to clear the board. You should call `background("color_name")` at the very beginning of your draw function. If you forget the `background("color_name")` then you will see overlapping copies of your sprites on the board.

```js
// INCORRECT
// no background("color_name"), so sprites will overlap

function draw() {
  // ...

  drawSprites();
}

// CORRECT

function draw() {
  background("white");

  // ...

  drawSprites();
}
```

### Text editing

Remember that you can use keyboard shortcuts when editing your programs in text mode. You can use the undo command in block mode as well. These commands will save you lots of time when writing code; use them!

| command | shortcut (chromebook) | shortcut (mac) |
| ------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| cut     | ctrl + x              | command + x    |
| copy    | ctrl + c              | command + c    |
| paste   | ctrl + v              | command + v    |
| undo    | ctrl + z              | command + z    |
