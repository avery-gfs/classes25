Depending on our expectations, the future might be something that we're trying to avert, or to hasten, or something that doesn't exist at all (if we expect the world to be the same in 100 years as it is now, then does \"the future\" have any real meaning)? The story illustrates how much our qualitative experience as individuals and our direction as a society are born from our shared struggle with our vision of the future."

I \"read\" it because my family shared an audible account, and my older brother got it for free with points. Listening to it was my first introduction to philosophy as a whole, and, because it was explained \"through jokes\", I found the logic to be much more understandable. Since then, I've read very few books by choice that were not at least philosophy related (although I haven't read too many philosophy books either)."

The immersive world and creative concepts have made sure that Eragon is one of my favorite fantasy worlds. I have read the entire series more than 6 times and I follow the progress of any new books. The character development throughout the series is amazing to watch. Also, the writer was 15 when he published the first book and the evolution of his writing style over the series is remarkable. "

This is an important novel that foreshadows many different modern concepts including identity and mental illness. Dr Jekyll's character is entertaining to follow throughout the novel as he struggles with certain aspects of his identity, and how he deals with facing his alter ego My Hyde. This book has a thrilling undertone to it which allows for readers to stay engaged and interested. I recommend this book to high school students because it makes for a fun read while still teaching about important concepts.  "

    "content": "I have been very affected by The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson. This fantasy series had very relatable characters and over the top climaxes that resonated with me when I was going through a tough time. In particular, Sanderson's masterful writing of Kaladen, a knight who is sold into slavery, masterfully talks about topics of mental health and depression while also creating a well rounded character with an intriguing backstory. His climaxes are also extremely well written. The first book of The Stormlight Archive has a climax that has been rated as “one of the best in fantasy” and it is easy to see why. Sanderson's masterful manipulation of his world led to a perfect conclusion."

It also helped me bond with my family, as my parents and my brother are fans of the series, so it gave me something to talk about with them. The long books seemed daunting to me as a first grader, but as soon as I started reading them, I got excited and intrigued by the complicated characters and plot. Once I read the first book, I knew I wanted to keep reading the entire series. After I finished the Harry Potter series, I felt confident enough to read other long chapter books. "

It also shows them what it can do to a person when they are giving too much, or don't notice when they ask for too much. \"The gift is in giving\" is what the story is saying but also to somewhat measure it. Throughout the novel, a boy asks for parts of the tree and the tree always says yes. By the end, the tree has become a stump, and that is when the boy finally realizes what he has done. He cries and feels horrible. Every child should read this story, because it will teach them to share and care, but also when to notice you are abusing that right."

    "content": "A book series that was special and influential to me was the Arc of a Scythe series, written by Neal Shusterman. It takes place in a dystopian society run by a powerful AI called the Thunderhead, who has conquered disease and death and therefore has set up a system of Scythes to \"glean\" people. Scythes are randomly selected people, often in their teens, who train under an older Scythe. Every year Scythes are given a quota to reach, and a maximum that they are not allowed to exceed. The book follows two main characters, Rowan and Citra, and their rocky paths to becoming Scythes in a new wave of Scythes. This new wave is lead by Scythe Goddard. Their primary belief is that killing is an enjoyable act meant to remind people of their mortality. This belief causes their main objective to be to conduct mass and public killings. As all dystopian books do, or at least good ones, it makes you think about relevant issues in today's society and amplifies them greatly to create a dystopic environment that makes you question the future evolution of our current society.

My attachment to the characters made their deaths immensely impactful. It felt like someone I personally knew had passed away.
