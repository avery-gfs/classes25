prompts:

ok, now make another app to collate and rank these results. app should have an input field for the ranking logs (will be the concatenation of a bunch of student logs), should be rank button to run when all logs are pasted in together. app should show each submission (these will come in the new list of objects format). for each submission, should show contents, prompts used, tool used, content char length, prompt char length, vote stats (wins and comparisons), win percentage, and elo ranking. should order submissions from top elo to bottom. actually, ammendment to the submission structure: { id: string, content: (string around 600 chars, multi line), type: ("human" | "ai"), tool: string, prompts: (string, multi-line) }, only including tool and prompts if type is ai. maybe color code human vs ai responses

looks good, increase font size for submission content a bit, show cards (will starting stats) before logs are pasted in. there will be roughly 20 submissions and around 500 rankings (single log entries). does elo have a learning rate? should we adjust it? scores seem similar for all
